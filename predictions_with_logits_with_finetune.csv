The adverse implications of such control is it destroys all price discovery, allows for corrupt members who are at the Fed to exploit this knowledge to their personal gain, protects companies from malfeasance and unethical corporate conduct by insulating the company share price, undermines market efficiency and distorts valuations. For example, a major conflict just broke out in Europe. The economic ramifications of this conflict were certainly fuel inflation in the U.S. The market naturally took a dump, which a healthy market is supposed to do in order to price in the adverse implications of the conflict in Europe. The Fed39s proxies proceeded to buy high volumes of futures contracts to push up the stocks in that index.

Thats sort of a doubling down of Bitcoin and ARK sentiment even during Massive Negative sentiment and Downturns. When Bitcoin finally runs, ARKW will also get another tailwind. TSLA was likely massively bought by ARKW at the open. If Tech, Bitcoin,Tesla all get wind in their sails, this could be quite a rebound for the next 12 months. ARKW was the first ARK Fund to own GBTC back in 201415 but when ARKK started buying, it really took off. This morning GBTC hit an interesting technical area that ARK has previously used as a buy.
